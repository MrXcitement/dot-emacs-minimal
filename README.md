# Emacs Minimal
A minimal setup for emacs.
Influenced by: [Emacs for You (Emfy)](https://github.com/susam/emfy)

## Install
Clone this repository to a folder you have access to.
I would recommend `$HOME/.local/config/dot-emacs-minimal`.
You can then symlink the `emacs-d` folder to your default `$HOME/.emacs.d` folder.
Or, if you would like to have multiple emacs configurations, checkout [chemacs2](https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2) and configure chemacs2 to use the `emacs-d` folder as one of the configs available to use.
